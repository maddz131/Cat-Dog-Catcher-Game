# Cat-Dog-Catcher-Game
Project from CSC 133, Fall 2015

Starts by running the Starter.java file. At the start of the game a user inputs the number of cats and dogs they want in play. The game works better with significantly more dogs than cats.

The cats are represented by green triangles and the dogs by red ovals that have triangular "heads" and circular "feet". These animals will move in random paths across the screen and bounce off the walls of the screen. The square on the screen is the net and can be moved up, down, left and right with the buttons to the left of the screen.

The goal is to scoop up dogs with the net. Points will be added to the users score according to the amount of dogs scooped and subtracted according to he amount of cats scooped. If a cat collides with a dog the dog is injured, indicated by a change in its color and shrinking of size. Every injury decreases the dogs value and with enough injuries it will freeze on the screen and no longer be worth any points. Users can heal the dogs by selecting the pause button to pause the game, selecting an injured dog and clicking the heal button.
